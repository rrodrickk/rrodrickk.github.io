        I'm 19-year-old born in Braga in Portugal, second-year Informatics/Software
        Engineering undergraduate at the University of Minho.
        Outside the campus and away from a desk I am studying jazz with guitar as
        my main instrument, my preferred genres other than jazz are neo-soul, blues,
        barber beats, shoegaze, rock, and my favorite inspirations as a musician are
        Miguel Araújo, Ganso, Pat Metheny, Pink FLoyd, Khruangbin, Sade, Masayoshi
        Takanaka, Casiopea, etc...(here's my <a style="font-weight: bold;color:#a96700;text-decoration:underline;"

        currently I am the lead guitarist and co-founder of a Rock-Pop band called
        <a style="font-weight: bold;color:#a96700;text-decoration:underline;"
          href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0XYxjDhjXN9VEgTs7Z59iq">Solmåne</a>,
        where I arrange, record and perform original material, with my fellow peers.

        My interest in this field was sparked at a young age. My father is a software
        engineer and I grew up with computers. I always wanted to develop/manage
        my own programs, so it was a natural progression for me. In the future I aim to do
        a masters degree in artificial intelligence and machine learning, and develop
        my skills torwards that area.
