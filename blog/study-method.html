how do I study better?
<br />
1. **Review after learning:**
    
    Information sticks better, if reviewed right after learned, being atentive in class is helpful, but the clutch method is to review what you’ve learned in class, for like 30 minutes. This in fact saves a lot of time because if the revision is made right after class the need to study in home is reduced by a large amount and you are still taking the advantage of the information still being fresh in your mind.
    
2. **Be at your highest potential**
    
    Slow down. Get rest, Workout, Eat healthy. Do your hobbies
    
    Keeping this momentum is really the key to be at optimal performance.
    
    The rest can be done, for instance stop working at 6/8 pm, 
    
    This is all for the sake of being sane, balance is key, and so rest is.
    
3. **Eliminate time between tasks**
    
    Don’t take long breaks. don't randomly open your phone while working, etc…
    
    This may seem counter intuitive since the last point is to promote the rest, but the buildup of the breaks could really affect your potential optimal flow state activity by nearly 50%.
    
    One routine that helps in this aspect is the **888 RULE:**
    
    **8** hours of personal time
    
    Hobbies, entertainment
    
    **8** hours of deep work
    
    Actual flow state work
    
    **8** hours of sleep
    
    Actual hygienic sleep
    
4. **Finish all work as soon as possible**
    
    This method helps greatly to prevent the procrastination, frees up the schedule, **“Fuck it, just do it”** rule or “eh, **“if I have to do it eventually, why not now?”** rule. 
    
    Also there’s the **“Snowball” method** that the amount of work increases exponentially as breaks went by.
    
  
    
    This can also apply to the “Eat the frog” which consists in doing the hardest task first 
    
5. **Do not follow cheat codes like this one religiously**
    
    Once again this may seem contradictory but if you spent your time watching productive videos you are still wasting your optimal time. 
    
    The harsh truth and sum up of this video is  the fourth point on this list.
    
    Stop watching videos how “you can do it” and actually take action and DO IT.
    
    Think this for a second , are you watching these types of videos to make yourself feel better?
    
    Take this quote:

    So the final cheat code is to shut up and do it.
