                <li>
                    <h2>Review after learning:</h2>
                    Information sticks better, if reviewed right after
                    learned, being attentive in class is helpful, but the
                    clutch method is to review what you've learned in class,
                    for like 30 minutes. This in fact saves a lot of time
                    because if the revision is made right after class the need
                    to study in home is reduced by a large amount and you are
                    still taking the advantage of the information still being
                    fresh in your mind.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    <h2>Be at your highest potential</h2>
                    Slow down. Get rest, Workout, Eat healthy. Do your hobbies
                    Keeping this momentum is really the key to be at optimal performance.
                    The rest can be done, for instance stop working at 6/8 pm.
                    This is all for the sake of being sane, balance is key, and so rest is.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    <h2>Eliminate time between tasks</h2>
                    Don't take long breaks. don't randomly open your phone while working, etc…
                    This may seem counter intuitive since the last point is to promote the rest, but the buildup of
                    the breaks could really affect your potential optimal flow state activity by nearly 50%.
                    One routine that helps in this aspect is the <strong>888 RULE:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>8</strong> hours of <strong>personal time</strong> - Hobbies, entertainment</li>
                        <li><strong>8</strong> hours of <strong>deep work</strong> - Actual flow state work</li>
                        <li><strong>8</strong> hours of <strong>sleep</strong> - Actual hygienic sleep</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    <h2>Finish all work as soon as possible</h2>
                    <p>This method helps greatly to prevent the procrastination, frees up
                        the schedule, <strong>"Fuck it, just do it"</strong> rule or
                        <strong>"eh, if I have to do it eventually, why not now?"</strong> rule.
                        Also there's the <strong>"Snowball" method</strong> that the amount of
                        work increases exponentially as breaks went by.
                    </p>

                    <p>This can also apply to the <strong>"Eat the frog"</strong>
                        which consists in doing the hardest task first</strong></p>
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    <p>
                    <h2>Do not follow cheat codes like this one religiously</h2>
                    Once again this may seem contradictory but if you spent your time
                    watching productive videos you are still wasting your optimal time. The
                    harsh truth and sum up of this video is the fourth point on this list.
                    Stop watching videos how "you can do it" and actually take action and
                    DO IT. Think this for a second, are you watching these types of videos to make yourself feel better?
                    </p>

                    <p><br />So the final cheat code is to shut up and do it.</p>
